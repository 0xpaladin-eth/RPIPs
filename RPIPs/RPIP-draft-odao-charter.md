## Abstract
There is broad agreement that the oDAO needs to be more clearly defined in terms of what they are
expected to do, and how they are expected to do it. This document is intended to be a foundational
definition document that will serve (a) the oDAO itself in answering "what's the right thing to do"
in a given situation, and (b) the greater community in understanding "what should we expect" and
"what shouldn't we expect" from the oDAO and its membership.

## Motivation
TODO: Is this section useful?

## Specification

### oDAO Values
1. The oDAO SHALL serve the RP community at large, which comprises rETH holders, NOs, and RPL holders, by upholding the values and responsibilities outlined in this charter
1. The oDAO SHALL NOT actively govern the protocol; they SHALL act as caretakers serving the RP community at large
    1. While the oDAO possesses the ability to veto (by refusing to apply an upgrade or settings change) veto powers SHALL be reserved for cases of changes that were not voted for by the pDAO, vote manipulation, malicious action, or proposals that would result in clear damage to the Rocket Pool project
        1. When a veto power is exercised, the oDAO SHALL publish a Veto Explanation Document that describes why this step was taken. If possible, the report SHOULD also suggest potential similar-but-non-damaging votes that could be considered.
    1. Except for the narrow veto circumstances described above, the oDAO SHALL execute the proposals that are ratified by a pDAO vote
1. The oDAO SHALL prioritize protocol safety
1. The oDAO SHALL minimize its role
    1. The oDAO SHOULD gradually and responsibly remove responsibilities where it is technically possible to do them in trustworthy and more decentralized means
    1. When no responsibilities remain, the oDAO SHALL support removal of the oDAO
1. The oDAO SHALL take on additional duties if required by the protocol
    1. Whenever possible, the oDAO SHOULD advocate for implementing duties without reliance on the oDAO and/or with an explicit plan to remove reliance on the oDAO
1. In addition to their explicitly defined duties, oDAO members SHOULD act as stewards for the protocol
1. The oDAO SHALL NOT abuse their position for personal gain
1. The oDAO SHALL actively govern themselves
    1. The oDAO SHALL select its membership
    1. The oDAO SHALL hold their membership accountable to the values listed here, especially as perceived by the RP community at large
    1. The oDAO SHOULD hold their membership accountable for performing the responsibilities listed here
    1. The oDAO SHOULD establish internal guidelines to select and remove members
    1. The oDAO SHOULD be transparent to the community about their self-governance outcomes
1. A vote to supersede this RPIP

### Current oDAO Responsibilities
1. oDAO members MUST be informed voters on protocol update proposals
1. The oDAO SHOULD actively communicate with the RP community at large
    1. It is RECOMMENDED that the oDAO explain their votes, including the reasoning and due diligence behind them
    1. It is RECOMMENDED that the oDAO have forums where they can discuss with the RP community at large (examples could be live town hall meetings, quarterly Q&A forum threads, etc)
    1. The oDAO MAY or MAY NOT be available for day-to-day discussions (eg, on discord)
    1. Communication MAY be done at member or group level
1. oDAO members SHOULD effectively fulfill oracle duties, including:

    1. oDAO membership settings
1. oDAO members SHOULD be informed voters on settings changes for settings controlled by the oDAO

## Abstract

RPIP-10 sets aside 30% of the pDAO budget for Grants and Bounties. The details of the mechanics of awarding grants and bounties were discussed in a forum post and in the Grants thread on the Discord Governance channel. Based on that previous work, we would like to suggest an outline for a Grants and Bounties Management Committee (hereafter GMC), including guiding principles and governance. Please see RPIP-10 for governance details that apply to all Management Committees. This RPIP supercedes RPIP-15, with changes to the committee size (enlarged to 9), the frequency of award rounds (from every-other-month to quarterly), and the removal of the requirement that a majority of the committee be made up of non-team, non-oDAO members.

## Motivation

In addition to the goals captured in RPIP-18, the 50% retrospective award cap has inadvertently created a bottleneck in the GMC's ability to distribute funds efficiently. The majority of submissions fall into the retrospective award category, causing a significant backlog. Removing the cap would allow the GMC to address the backlog and honor the contributions of community members who have made significant contributions to the protocol.

## Specification

### Operations

This proposal SHALL remove the retrospective awards cap outlined in RPIP-18 to alleviate the challenges faced by the GMC.

## Rationale

In addition to the goals captured in RPIP-18, the cap was initially implemented to promote interest in grants and encourage new contributions. However, it has resulted in a backlog that limits the GMC's ability to distribute funds effectively. Removing the cap would address this issue and provide the GMC with the flexibility to allocate funds and pay back retroactive awards promptly.

Without taking steps to ensure the timely payment of retroactive awards, the backlog could continue to grow, making it increasingly difficult and time-consuming to address.

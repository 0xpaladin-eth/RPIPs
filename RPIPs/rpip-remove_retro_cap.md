## Abstract

The current retrospective award cap outlined in RPIP-18 has created challenges for the Grants and Bounties Management Committee (GMC) in effectively disbursing retroactive awards. This proposal suggests removing the cap to address the backlog of projects and enable timely payment of retroactive awards.

## Motivation

The 50% retrospective award cap has inadvertently created a bottleneck in the GMC's ability to distribute funds efficiently. The majority of submissions fall into the retrospective award category, causing a significant backlog. Removing the cap would allow the GMC to address the backlog and honor the contributions of community members who have made significant contributions to the protocol.

## Specification

This proposal SHALL remove the retrospective awards cap outlined in RPIP-18 to alleviate the challenges faced by the GMC.

## Rationale

The cap was initially implemented to promote interest in grants and encourage new contributions. However, it has resulted in a backlog that limits the GMC's ability to distribute funds effectively. Removing the cap would address this issue and provide the GMC with the flexibility to allocate funds and pay back retroactive awards promptly.

Without taking steps to ensure the timely payment of retroactive awards, the backlog could continue to grow, making it increasingly difficult and time-consuming to address. It could potentially take years to pay back all retroactive awards, leading to dissatisfaction and discouragement among community members. By removing the cap and proactively addressing the backlog, the GMC can demonstrate its commitment to fairness, transparency, and rewarding past contributions.

## Backwards Compatibility

It is important to note that there is no evidence to suggest that the GMC is favoring retroactive awards over grants and bounties. The allocation process is facing difficulties due to the overwhelming volume of retroactive award submissions, which has resulted in a backlog of projects.

The pDAO has the ability to vote on whether to reinstate the retroactive awards cap in the future. At any point in time, the pDao can reassess the situation and make a collective decision, to ensure there is a fair balance between retroactive awards, grants, and bounties.

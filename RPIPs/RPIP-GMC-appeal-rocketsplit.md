## Abstract
This proposal looks to challenge the GMC decision on application GA032303 (Rocket Split) and fund the project. Ramana first applied in April and incorporated feedback from the GMC in the July application. During the July deliberations, the GMC misunderstood the proposal. 

## Rationale
- Ramana first applied for this project during the April GMC round. The GMC did not approve and asked Ramana to reapply after incorporating “mentor’s requirements”. Apparently these requirements were about the need for a frontend for the project. The July re-application appears to satisfy these requirements.

 
The GMC explained its decision to decline in the results post:
> Team is working on things that would make this obsolete

[...]

- Last but not least, I believe this is a promising project and the community has already shown some interest in the concept of marriage contracts. Making them more accessible and customizable makes a lot of sense to me.

## Specification
The GMC SHALL pay 500(???) RPL to LIBlockchain/Ramana upon completion of the work on Rocket Split as outlined in the application.

## Abstract
It would be useful to more explicitly define the pDAO in terms of who they are, what they are
expected to do, and how they are expected to do it. This document is intended to be a foundational
definition document that will serve (a) the pDAO itself in answering "what's the right thing to do"
in a given situation, and (b) the greater community in understanding "what should we expect" and
"what shouldn't we expect" from the pDAO.

## Specification

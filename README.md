# Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals (RPIPs)

Simlar to the [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) repository](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs), this repository contains Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals (RPIPs). Currently, it's in a draft form, as this process is not yet officially adopted by Rocket Pool.

For easy viewing of existing RPIPs, please see the [RPIP dashboard](https://rpips.netlify.app/).
Note that, for now, the dashboard must be manually rebuilt and published when the repo changes.

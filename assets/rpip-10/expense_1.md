Funding for the team at the current number of seats is based on making up for inflation changes.

| Period   | RPL to team before changes | RPL to team with inflation changes | Amount to make up |
|----------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 11       | 2434                       | 1298                               | 1136              |
| 12       | 2443                       | 1303                               | 1140              |
| 13       | 2452                       | 1144                               | 1308              |
| **Net**  | **7329**                   | **3745**                           | **3584**          |

The bonus will:
- make up for the reduced amount the team gets with one seat; the reduction is 3/4 of the 3rd column above
- add a 15% bonus on the original amount  

| Period | RPL reduction due to seat reduction | 15% bonus on amount before changes | Sum  |

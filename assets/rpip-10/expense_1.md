This expense has two parts. The first is intended to make up for the reduced funding the team
receives from their oDAO seats based on the recent inflation changes.

| Period | RPL to team before changes | RPL to team with inflation changes | Amount to make up |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 11     | 2434.229871                |                        1298.255931 |        1135.97394 |
| 12     | 2443.382919                |                        1303.137557 |       1140.245362 |
| 13     | 2452.570384                |                        1144.532846 |       1308.037538 |

Further, we'd like to encourage the team to reduce their number of seats from 4 to 1 in support of
oDAO diversity. In periods ending after they do so, they will instead receive the full amount in
"RPL to team if unchanged", while also receiving the full amount in "RPL to team w/inflation and
number of seats change". This amounts to a ~15% increase in funding.

| Period | RPL to team w/inflation and number of seats changed |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 11     | 389.4767794                                         |
| 12     | 390.9412671                                         |
| 13     | 343.3598538                                         |


The total expense thus varies based on when the dev team reduce their number of seats.
- Send 3585 RPL to cover 3 periods immediately
- If the dev team reduce to 1 seat before the end of period 11: send 3745 additional RPL
- If the dev team reduce to 1 seat before the end of period 12: send 2448 additional RPL
- If the dev team reduce to 1 seat before the end of period 13: send 1145 additional RPL

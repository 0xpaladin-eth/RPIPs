# Specification for Rewards Tree File

This documents serves as a formal specification for the format and naming of Rewards Tree Files. 
These files are generated by the oDAO in an implicit format, prior to this specification. 
This specification serves to define their expected format, naming convention, and CID calcuation methodology.

# Contents

The oDAO shall save Rewards Trees in [ssz](../assets/rpip-52/simple-serialize.md) format respecting the following specification.

## Containers

### File

```python
class File(Container):
    magic: Bytes4 # Magic Header identifying this file as a Rewards Tree
                  # Expected value: 0x52 0x50 0x52 0x54

    total_node_weight: uint256 # Total Node Weight as defined by RPIP-30 (in wei)

class NetworkReward(Container):
    network: uint64 # The L1 or L2 id that this object describes rewards for
                    # Currently, only mainnet is supported, with id of 0
    collateral_rpl: uint256 # Amount of RPL for Node Operators sent to this network (in wei)
    oracle_dao_rpl: uint256 # Amount of RPL for oDAO Operators sent to this network (in wei)
    smoothing_pool_eth: uint256 # Amount of ETH for Node Operators sent to this network (in wei)

class NodeReward(Container):
    address: Bytes20 # Address of the node that this object describes rewards for
    network: uint64 # The L1 or L2 id that the node will claim on
                    # Corresponds to a NetworkReward.network in the File.network_rewards list
                    # 0 means L1
    collateral_rpl: uint256 # RPL staking rewards earned by this node operator (in wei)
    oracle_dao_rpl: uint256 # RPL rewards earned by this oDAO member (in wei)
                            # If the node is not in the oDAO the expected value is 0
    smoothing_pool_eth: uint256 # Smoothing Pool ETH earned by this node operator (in wei)
                                # If the node was not in the smoothing pool during the interval,
                                # the expected value is 0
```

# Naming

The file SHALL be serialized with the binary representation of the above specified format and named according to convention.

The file SHALL be named `rp-rewards-{NETWORK}-{INTERVAL}.ssz` with the following substitutions:

  * Substitute the name of the network from the below table for {NETWORK}
  * Substitute the number of the interval, in decimal with no leading zeroes, for {INTERVAL}

## Networks
| Network | {NETWORK} |
| ------- | --------- |
| Mainnet | mainnet   |
| Holešky | holesky   |
| devnet  | devnet    |
